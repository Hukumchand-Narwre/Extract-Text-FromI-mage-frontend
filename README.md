## Challenges Faced

Integrating Azure Cloud for the storage of images was a new experience, and I had to navigate through Azure's documentation to understand the process of setting up and configuring Azure Storage.

Working with OCR technology for the first time posed challenges in terms of understanding the API documentation, handling image formats, and interpreting the output.
